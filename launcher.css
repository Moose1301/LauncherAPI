    content: "For the past couple of months weâ€™ve been working on making Aero Clientâ€™s 1.8 return as well as a now 1.16 release! We were going to 1.15, however we feel 1.16 will benefit our users more! These new versions will include new mods and very a user friendly mod menu, as well as a few surprises! We know weâ€™ve been quiet recently but weâ€™ve got a big update in the works. It is well worth the wait! Stay tuned! ðŸ‘€";
